Revision history for IRC-Channel-Log

{{$NEXT}}

0.0.37  2021-10-14T12:39:15+02:00
    - Tweak the default for batch / degree from some experimenting.
      Turns out using half of the CPU cores makes things actually
      faster than using all of them.  Probably because of hyperthreading
      only making sense on different kinds of loads, and we're doing
      a lot of the same when building a IRC::Channel::Log object.
