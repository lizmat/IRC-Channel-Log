=head1 DESCRIPTION

IRC::Channel::Log provides a programmatic interface to the IRC log files
of a channel.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

=begin code :lang<raku>
use IRC::Log::Colabti;  # class implementing one day of logs
use IRC::Channel::Log;

my $channel = IRC::Channel::Log.new(
  logdir    => "logs/raku",        # directory containing logs
  class     => IRC::Log::Colabti,  # class implementing log parsing logic
  generator => &generator,        # generate color for nick
  name      => "foobar",           # name of channel, default: logdir.basename
  state     => "state",            # directory containing persistent state info
  batch     => 1,                  # number of logs parsed / time, default: 16
  degree    => 8,                  # threads used, default: Kernel.cpu-cores/2
);
=end code

The C<new> class method returns an C<IRC::Channel::Log> object.  It takes
four named arguments:

=head3 :logdir

The directory (either as a string or as an C<IO::Path> object) in which
log file of the channel is located, as created by a logger such as
C<IRC::Client::Plugin::Logger>.  This expects the directories to be
organized by year, with all the logs of each day of a year in that
directory.  For example, in the test of this module:

  raku
   |-- 2021
        |-- 2021-04-23
        |-- 2021-04-24

This argument is required.

=head3 :batch

The batch size to use when racing to read all of the log files of the
given channel.  Defaults to 16 as an apparent optimal values to optimize
for wallclock and not have excessive CPU usage.  You can use C<:!batch>
to indicate you do not want any multi-threading: this is equivalent to
specifying C<1> or C<0> or C<True>.

=head3 :class

The class to be used to interpret log files, e.g. C<IRC::Log::Colabti>.
This argument is also required.

=head3 :degree

The maximum number of threads to be used when racing to read all of the
log files of the given channel.  Defaults to C<Kernel.cpu-cores/2> (aka 
half the number of CPU cores the system claims to have).

=head3 :generator

A C<Callable> expected to take a nick and return a color to be associated
with that nick.

=head3 :name

The name of the channel.  Optional.  Defaults to the base name of the
directory specified with C<logdir>.

=head3 :state

The directory (either as a string or as an C<IO::Path> object) in which
persistent state information of the channel is located.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 active

=begin code :lang<raku>
say "$channel.name() is active" if $channel.active;
=end code

The C<active> instance method returns whether the channel is considered to
be active.  If a C<state> directory has been specified, and that directory
contains a file named "inactive", then the channel is considered to B<not>
be active.

=head2 aliases-for-nick-name
=begin code :lang<raku>
my @aliases = $channel.aliases-for-nick-name($nick);

=end code

The C<aliases-for-nick-name> instance method returns a sorted list of nick
names that are assumed to be aliases (aka, have the same color) for the
given nick name.

=head2 cleaned-nick

=begin code :lang<raku>
my $cleaned = $channel.cleaned-nick-name($nick);
=end code

The C<cleaned-nick-name> instance method returns the cleaned version of
the given nick nae, which is used to group together the aliases of a
nick name.

=head2 dates

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.dates;          # the dates for which there are logs available
=end code

The C<dates> instance method returns a sorted list of dates (as strings
in YYYY-MM-DD format) of which there are entries available.

=head2 entries

=begin code :lang<raku>
.say for $channel.entries;             # all entries in chronological order

.say for $channel.entries(:reverse);   # in reverse chronological order

.say for $channel.entries(:contains<question>); # containing text

.say for $channel.entries(:control);            # control messages only

.say for $channel.entries(:conversation);       # conversational messages only

.say for $channel.entries(:dates<2021-04-23>);  # for one or more dates

.say for $channel.entries(:matches(/ \d+ /);    # matching regex

.say for $channel.entries(:starts-with<m:>);    # starting with text

.say for $channel.entries(:contains<foo>);      # containing string

.say for $channel.entries(:words<foo>);         # containing word

.say for $channel.entries(:nicks<lizmat>);      # for one or more nicks

.say for $channel.entries(:before-target($target);  # entries before target

.say for $channel.entries(:from-target($target);    # entries from target

.say for $channel.entries(:after-target($target);   # entries after target

.say for $channel.entries(:around-target($target);  # entries around target

.say for $channel.entries(:@targets);           # entries of given targets

.say for $channel.entries(
  :dates<2021-04-23>,
  :nicks<lizmat japhb>,
  :contains<question answer>, :all,
);
=end code

The C<entries> instance method is *the* workhorse for selecting entries
from the log.  It will always return messages in chronological order.

It takes a number of (optional) named arguments that allows you to select
the entries from the log that you need.  Named arguments may be combined,
although some combinations do not make a lot of sense (which will generally
mean that some of them will be ignored).

If no (valid) named arguments are specified, then B<all> entries from
the log will be produced: this allows you to do any ad-hoc filtering.

The following named arguments are supported:

=head3 :after-target

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:after-target<2021-04-23Z23:36>);
=end code

The C<after-target> named argument can be used with any of the other named
arguments (with the exception of C<reverse>, which it overrides as
C<:!reverse>).  It will limit any entries to those that have a C<target>
value B<greater> than the value provided.

Targets are formatted as C<YYYY-MM-DDZHH:MM-NNNN> with the C<-NNNN> removed
if it would have been C<-0000>.

=head3 :all

The C<all> named argument can only be used in combination with the C<contains>
and C<words> named arguments.  If specified with a true value, it will force
entries to only be selected if B<all> conditions are true.

=head3 :around-target

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:around-target<2021-04-23Z23:36>);  # default 10 entries

$channel.entries(:around-target<2021-04-23Z23:36>, :nr-entries(5));
=end code

The C<around-target> named argument can be used with any of the other named
arguments (with the exception of C<reverse>).  It will return any entries
before and after to the entry with the C<target>.  By default, B<10> entries
will be selected before B<and> after the target (thus returning a maximum
of 21 entries).  The C<nr-entries> named argument can be used to indicate
the number of entries before / after should be fetched.

Targets are formatted as C<YYYY-MM-DDZHH:MM-NNNN> with the C<-NNNN> removed
if it would have been C<-0000>.

=head3 :before-target

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:after-target<2021-04-24Z02:50>);
=end code

The C<before-target> named argument can be used with any of the other named
arguments (with the exception of C<reverse>, which it overrides as
C<:reverse>).  It will limit any entries to those that have a C<target>
value B<smaller> than the value provided.

Targets are formatted as C<YYYY-MM-DDZHH:MM-NNNN> with the C<-NNNN> removed
if it would have been C<-0000>.

=head3 :contains

=begin code :lang<raku>
# just "question"
$channel.entries(:contains<question>);

# "question" or "answer"
$channel.entries(:contains<question answer>);

# "question" or "answer"
$channel.entries(:contains<question answer>, :ignorecase);

# "question" and "answer"
$channel.entries(:contains<question answer>, :all);
=end code

The C<contains> named argument allows specification of one or more
strings that an entry should contain.  By default, an entry should
only contain one of the specified strings to be selected.  If you
want an entry to contain B<all> strings, then an additional C<:all>
named argument can be specified (with a true value).

If comparisons need to be done in an case-insensitive manner, then
the C<ignorecase> named argument can be specified with a true value.

Since this only applies to conversational entries, any additional
setting of the C<conversation> or C<control> named arguments are
ignored.

=head3 :control

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:control);   # control messages only

$channel.entries(:!control);  # all but control messages
=end code

The C<control> named argument specifies whether to limit to control
messages only or not.

=head3 :conversation

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:conversation);   # conversational messages only

$channel.entries(:!conversation);  # all but conversational messages
=end code

The C<conversation> named argument specifies whether to limit to
conversational messages only or not.

=head3 :dates

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:dates<2021-04-23>);   # just on one date

my @dates = Date.today ... Date.today.earlier(:3days);
$channel.entries(:@dates);              # multiple dates
=end code

The C<dates> named argument allows one to specify the date(s) from
which entries should be selected.  Dates can be specified in anything
that will stringify in the YYYY-MM-DD format, but are expected to be in
ascending sort order.

=head3 :from-target

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:from-target<2021-04-23Z23:36>);
=end code

The C<from-target> named argument can be used with any of the other named
arguments (with the exception of C<reverse>, which it overrides as
C<:!reverse>).  It will limit any entries to those that have a C<target>
value B<greater than or equal to> the value provided.

Targets are formatted as C<YYYY-MM-DDZHH:MM-NNNN> with the C<-NNNN> removed
if it would have been C<-0000>.

=head3 :ignorecase

The C<ignorecase> named argument can only be used in combination with the
C<starts-with>, C<contains> and C<words> named arguments.  If specified with
a true value, it will do all comparisons in a case-insensitive manner.

=head3 :matches

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:matches(/ \d+ /);    # matching regex
=end code

The C<matches> named argument allows one to specify a C<Regex> to
indicate which entries should be selected.

Since this only applies to conversational entries, any additional
setting of the C<conversation> or C<control> named arguments are
ignored.

=head3 :nick-names

=begin code :lang<raku>
$channel.entries(:nick-names<lizmat>);        # limit to "lizmat"

$channel.entries(:nick-names<lizmat japhb>);  # limit to "lizmat" or "japhb"
=end code

The C<nick-names> named argument allows one to specify one or more
nick names to indicate which entries should be selected.

=head3 :nr-entries

The C<nr-entries> named argument can only be used in combination with
the C<around-target> argument.  It specifies how many entries should
be fetched before / after the given target.

=head3 :reverse

=begin code :lang<raku>
.say for $channel.entries(:reverse);   # all messages, most recent first
.say for $channel.entries(:!reverse);  # all messages, oldest first
=end code

The C<reverse> named argument allows one to specify the order in which entries
will be returned.  If specified with a true value, it will return the most
recent entries first, in reverse chronological order.

=head3 :starts-with

=begin code :lang<raku>
# starts with "m:"
$channel.entries(:starts-with<m:>);

# starts with "how" in any case
$channel.entries(:starts-with<how>, :ignorecase);

# starts with "m:" or "j:"
$channel.entries(:starts-with<m: j:>);
=end code

The C<start-with> named argument allows specification of one or more
strings that an entry should start with.

If comparisons need to be done in an case-insensitive manner, then
the C<ignorecase> named argument can be specified with a true value.

Since this only applies to conversational entries, any additional
setting of the C<conversation> or C<control> named arguments are
ignored.

=head3 :targets

=begin code :lang<raku>
.say for $channel.entries(:@targets);
=end code

The C<targets> named argument allows specification of one or more targets
for which to return the associated entry.

=head3 :words

=begin code :lang<raku>
# contains the word "foo"
$channel.entries(:words<foo>);

# contains the word "foo" or "bar"
$channel.entries(:words<foo bar>);

# contains the word "foo" or the word "bar" in any case
$channel.entries(:words<foo bar>, :ignorecase);

# contains the word "foo" *and* "bar"
$channel.entries(:words<foo bar>, :all);
=end code

The C<words> named argument allows specification of one or more words that
an entry should contain.  By default, an entry should only contain one of
the specified words to be selected.  If you want an entry to contain B<all>
words, then an additional C<:all> named argument can be specified (with a
true value).

If comparisons need to be done in an case-insensitive manner, then
the C<ignorecase> named argument can be specified with a true value.

Since this only applies to conversational entries, any additional
setting of the C<conversation> or C<control> named arguments are
ignored.

=head2 initial-topic

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.initial-topic($date);
=end code

The C<initial-topic> instance method takes a date (either as a
C<Date> object or as a string) and returns the log entry of the
topic (as a ::Topic object) of the channel on that date.  Returns
C<Nil> if no topic is known for the given date.

=head2 is-first-date-of-month

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.is-first-date-of-month($date);
=end code

The C<is-first-date-of-month> instance method takes a date (either as a
C<Date> object or as a string) and returns whether that date is the
first date of the month, according to availability in the logs.

=head2 is-first-date-of-year

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.is-first-date-of-year($date);
=end code

The C<is-first-date-of-month> instance method takes a date (either as a
C<Date> object or as astring) and returns whether that date is the first
date of the year, according to availability in the logs.

=head2 log

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.log($date);  # log object for given date
=end code

The C<log> instance method takes a string representing a date, and returns
the C<class> object for that given date.  Returns C<Nil> if there is no
log available on the specified date.

=head2 next-date

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.next-date($date);  # date after the given date with a log
=end code

The C<next-date> instance method takes a string representing a date, and
returns a string with the B<next> date of logs that are available.  Returns
C<Nil> if the specified date is the last date or after that.

=head2 nick-names

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.nick-names;  # the nick names for which there are logs available
=end code

The C<nick-names> instance method returns a sorted list of all the nick
names seen.

=head2 prev-date

=begin code :lang<raku>
say $channel.prev-date($date);  # date before the given date with a log
=end code

The C<prev-date> instance method takes a string representing a date, and
returns a string with the B<previous> date of logs that are available.
Returns C<Nil> if the specified date is the first date or before that.

=head2 problems

=begin code :lang<raku>
.say for $channel.problems;  # the dates with log parsing problems
=end code

The C<problems> instance method returns a sorted list of C<Pair>s with

say $channel.this-date($date);  # date after / before the given date
=end code

The C<this-date> instance method takes a string representing a date, and
returns a string with the B<first> date of logs that are available.  This
could be either the given date, or the next date, or the previous date
(if there was no next date).  Returns C<Nil> if no dates could be found,
which would effectively mean that there are B<no> dates in the log.

C<Promise> in which it watches for any updates in the most recent logs.
If there are any updates, it will process them and make sure that all the
internal state is correctly updated.

It optionally takes a C<post-process> named argument with a C<Callable> that
will be called with any C<IRC::Log> entries that have been added to the channel
log.
